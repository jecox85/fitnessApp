    <h5 class="center-align">About</h5>
    <p>
        This contents of this exercise program were found on the r/bodyweightfitness subreddit on reddit.com and it outlined
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This routine is intended as a full-body exercise routine done with minimal equipment and is intended to be done no
        more than three times a week with a minimum of one rest day between workout days.
    </p>
    <h5 class="center-align">How Progressions Work</h5>
    <p>
        Athletes should choose a progression difficulty based on their current fitness level.  They should start with 3
        sets of 5 reps of that progression with good form and should only move to the next progression when they are
        able to perform 3 sets of 8 reps.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the exercise is a static hold, the athlete should start progressions at 10-30 seconds and should only move to
        the next progression when they can hold 30 seconds for all 3 sets.
